# VoiceOps

Speak the outcome. VoiceOps sees the current screen, completes the work on the real Mac, and proves the requested result occurred.

VoiceOps is a voice-first macOS action agent: press a hotkey, speak a goal, and VoiceOps interprets the live screen, plans a safe sequence of actions, operates native Mac applications, and independently verifies the resulting state.

**Core loop:** Speak → Ground → Plan → Preview risk → Act → Observe → Verify → Report evidence

## Status

Phase 1 — voice shell: global hotkey (⌃⌥V), streaming system speech capture, floating companion with deterministic session states, stop/Escape cancellation, and spoken progress. The transcript flows to the mock Python sidecar and back (plan + verified completion). See `docs/` for the full spec:

## Requirements

- macOS 14.2+ on Apple Silicon (developed against Swift 6 / Xcode 26)
- Python 3.12 via [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Quick start

```sh
scripts/bootstrap.sh          # uv sync + swift build
scripts/run_sidecar.sh        # start the Python sidecar (NDJSON on stdio)

cd agent && uv run pytest     # Python tests
cd macos && swift test        # Swift tests
cd macos && swift run voiceops-mock-client   # end-to-end mock exchange
```

### Run the app

```sh
scripts/run_app.sh            # builds with the CLI toolchain and launches — no Xcode IDE needed
```

(Opening `macos/VoiceOps.xcodeproj` in Xcode works too, but is optional.) On first use, grant the Microphone and Speech Recognition prompts. Then:

1. Press **⌃⌥V** anywhere and speak a goal — the floating companion shows the live transcript.
2. Press **⌃⌥V** again (or pause) to finish. The request goes to the Python sidecar; the companion walks through planning → acting → result with spoken progress.
3. **Stop** (or Escape while the companion has focus) cancels capture and any running task.

## Layout

```
agent/     Python 3.12 sidecar: schemas, orchestration, planning, verification, evals
macos/     Swift 6 shell: VoiceOpsCore package (IPC types, mock client); app project in Phase 1
schemas/   JSON Schema exports generated from the Pydantic models
fixtures/  Shared test fixtures, including fixtures/ipc/ contract fixtures
scripts/   bootstrap, sidecar launch, demo seed/reset, eval runner
evals/     Evaluation cases, expected outcomes, reports
```

## Invariants

Executors never declare success — only the verifier can. Screen content is untrusted data. Consequential actions require explicit approval. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full list.
